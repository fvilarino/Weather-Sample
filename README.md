# Weather-Sample
A simple weather app showcasing some of the material principles.

The app consists of 2 screens, a city search screen and a weahter screen. The weather screen is itself split into 2 sections, current weather and forecast.

To run the app please obtain a key from RapidApi (https://rapidapi.com/) for both the geo cities (https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities) and the open weather map (https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map) and then update the app's `Versions.kt` file.
